add a country selection opetion

Add mobile emulation (iPhone, Android)

Random comment's typing use llm

show open side popup. we user can se broswer name, and all fringerprint details

Avoid browser automation detection (disable navigator.webdriver etc.).

Adjust based on device type (mobile/tablet/desktop)

Random selection failure attempts (to mimic user mistakes)

Emulate mobile vs desktop patterns
Mobile-style scroll flick gestures

Simulate reading time per section

📱 Add Mobile-like Scroll Flicks (If you want mobile traffic)

-   Faster, higher momentum scrolls with fast deceleration

Unless the site uses **deep fingerprinting or session analytics**, your bot should blend in well.

## 🧠 **What Advanced Detection Might Still Try (And How to Beat It)**
